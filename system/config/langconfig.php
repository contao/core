/**
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CUSTOM LABELS
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If you want to modify a language file, you do not have to edit it
 * directly. You can save your changes in this configuration file instead.
 * Thus, you can update or replace the original files without having to
 * worry about your modifications.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 *   $GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['tl_layout']['column'] = 'Section';
 * 
 * This line would replace the original label ("Column") with a custom
 * label ("Section"). You can also set different languages:
 * 
 *   if ($GLOBALS['TL_LANGUAGE'] == 'de')
 *   {
 *     $GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['tl_layout']['column'] = 'Bereich';
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *     $GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['tl_layout']['column'] = 'Section';
 *   }
 * 
 * This line would replace the original label with a custom german label
 * or an english label that is used as fallback.
