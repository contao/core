 *
 * If you want to modify a data container file, you do not have to edit it
 * directly but you can use this configuration file to save your changes.
 * Thus, you can update or replace the original files without having to 
 * worry about your modifications.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * 
 *   $GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_article']['config']['doNotCopyRecords'] = true;
 * 
 * This line would prevent articles from being duplicated when you duplicate 
 * a page in module site structure.
