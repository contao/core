About
-----

Contao is an open source content management system (CMS) for people who want a
professional internet presence that is easy to maintain. The state-of-the-art
structure of the system offers a high security standard and allows you to
develop search engine friendly websites that are also accessible for people with
disabilities. Furthermore, the system can be expanded flexibly and
inexpensively. Easy management of user rights, the Live Update Service, the
modern CSS framework and many already integrated modules (news, calendar, forms,
etc.) have quickly made Contao one of the most popular open source content
management systems on the market.
